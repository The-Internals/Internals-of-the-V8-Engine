## Discussion recording 

https://youtu.be/4lYDlrjUx48

## Agenda

What is a JavaScript engine?

What happens when a browser comes across a script tag? - The journey of a JavaScript file from downloading to execution.

Different attributes that you can use with scripts - async/defer why you should use them?

Components of V8 - Parser, Interpreter, Compiler

How V8 parses a javascript file
- What is an AST and how a javascript code is converted into an AST
- Lazy and eager parsing
- Heuristics employed by V8 for parsing
- What are scopes and how are they generated by the parser?
- What is Just in time compilation and how V8 uses that?

What is a bytecode?

How V8 compiles and interpretes the bytecode?

Optimizations done by V8

Understanding Object Model - How V8 makes some optimizations based on the shapes of the objects

Understanding Arrays
- Why you shouldn't have holes in your arrays
- Optimizations done by V8 based on the type of elements stored in arrays

What is hot code and how V8 decides that a particular snippet of code is hot?

What are inline caches?

Intro on how JS engine creates and maintains environment record and life-cycle of a variable depends on it
(Understanding environment record and variable life-cycle involves reading from multiple sources, as there is not a single page that describes all of it together)
